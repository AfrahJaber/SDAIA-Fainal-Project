## 🎯 Objectives
- **Accident Detection:** Utilize **YOLOv8** to identify accidents from video footage in real-time.  
- **Report Generation:** Apply **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to produce detailed reports about causes and contexts.  
- **Cause Analysis:** Extract and analyze accident causes for better understanding of root factors.  
- **Congestion Reduction:** Provide insights to improve traffic flow and reduce delays.  
- **Safety Enhancement:** Support authorities with actionable information to design effective safety policies.
